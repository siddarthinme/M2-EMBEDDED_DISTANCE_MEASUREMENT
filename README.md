# Distance measuremnet using Atmega328 and Ultrasnic sensor
This application is based upon the reflection of sound waves. Sound waves are defined as longitudinal pressure waves in the medium in which they are travelling. Subjects whose dimensions are larger than the wavelength of the impinging sound waves reflect them, the reflected waves are called the echo. If the speed of sound in the medium is known and the time taken for the sound waves to travel the distance from the source to the subject and back to the source is measured, the distance from the source to the subject can be computed accurately
